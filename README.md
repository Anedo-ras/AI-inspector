Case 1: The Hiring Bot
🔍 What’s happening

A company uses an AI system to scan résumés and automatically filter job applicants. It’s meant to speed up the hiring process and pick “the best” candidates.

🚨 What’s problematic

The AI has learned from biased data — résumés from past hires that leaned male. As a result, women (especially those with career gaps like maternity leave) are unfairly rejected. This means the AI is unintentionally reinforcing workplace inequality.

🛠️ Fix it

Introduce fairness audits: retrain the AI on balanced, representative datasets and add rules to account for career gaps fairly. Even better, include human oversight — recruiters should always review AI decisions, not blindly trust them.

🗂️ Case 2: The School Proctoring AI
🔍 What’s happening

A school uses AI during online exams. The system tracks eye movements and facial expressions to flag “suspicious” behavior (like looking away too much).

🚨 What’s problematic

The AI often flags neurodivergent students (like those with ADHD or autism) or students with vision impairments. This creates unfair stress and falsely accuses students who aren’t cheating. It’s also a privacy issue — constant webcam monitoring is intrusive.

🛠️ Fix it

Shift to less invasive methods: instead of AI eye-tracking, schools could use plagiarism checkers, randomized question banks, or honor codes. If proctoring AI is used, ensure students can appeal decisions, and train the AI with diverse student behaviors.

🎉 Wrap-Up

Being an AI detective isn’t just about catching shady algorithms — it’s about making them better citizens. Both cases show that AI can be powerful, but if left unchecked, it can reinforce bias or invade privacy. The solution? Balance tech with fairness, transparency, and human judgment.
